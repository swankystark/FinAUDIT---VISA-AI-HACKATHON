## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. 🌍 Multi-Regulation Compliance Engine
Switch instantly between global standards to re-evaluate your dataset:
- **GDPR**: Data minimization, purpose limitation, and PII checks.
- **Visa CEDP**: Cardholder data security and ecosystem protection.
- **AML / FATF**: Anti-Money Laundering checks (KYC, Source of Funds).
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry security and storage rules.
- **Basel II / III**: Financial risk data aggregation and reporting.
- **General Transaction**: Baseline data quality and hygiene checks.

### 2. 🤖 Independent AI Auditor
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: The AI adapts its persona based on the selected standard (e.g., acts as a Privacy Officer for GDPR, Risk Manager for Basel).
- **Strategic Recommendations**: prioritizes fixes (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW).
- **Dynamic Chat**: Ask "Why did Rule X fail?" or "How do I fix the KYC gaps?" via the built-in Compliance Assistant.

### 3. 📊 Deterministic Data Quality Scoring
- **6-Dimension Scoring**: Completeness, Validity, Accuracy, Uniqueness, Consistency, Timeliness.
- **30+ Hard Rules**: Specific checks for negative amounts, impossible dates, schema drift, null clusters, and more.
- **Privacy-First**: Analysis is performed on **Metadata Only**. Raw PII never leaves your secure environment.

### 4. 📝 Audit Reporting
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional "Independent Auditor's Reports" with hash-signed provenance.
- **Attestation**: Cryptographic fingerprinting of the analysis for audit trails.
